I have created a website, or a collection of websites in order to solve this task.

The title of the webiste "The important things in life" indicate that these are things i value, and therefore i am gratefull to have them.

The following is a structure of "Prosjekt 1":

Prosjekt 1
- fonts/
---- VTKSSALGROSSO.ttf
- graphics/
---- bike-2.jpeg
---- bike-3.jpg
---- bike-4.jpeg
---- bike.jpg
---- icon.png
---- music-2.jpg
---- music-3.jpg
---- music-4.jpg
---- music.jpg
- scripts/
---- bike-quotes.js
---- music-quotes.js
- stylesheets/
---- style.css
- bike.html
- index.html
- music.html
- readme.txt

SOLUTION TO THE TASKS:
1. The file "style.css" is used to style alle the elements on the website.

2. Flexbox is used on all the pages. I have created a twelve column layout, and divided all the rows into sections.

3. There is not much interactivity on the site, but a random quote is displayed each time the pages are visited.

4. In the header of every page, the favicon "icon.png" is initialized.

5. Alle HTML-files are validated using "W3C markup validator", and are tested in the following browsers:
	- Safari
	- Google Chrome
	- Mozilla Firefox
	- Opera

No errors during validation, only warning about headers in sections. Those are ignored, because there are no headers needed in every section.
All browsers render the websites without problems.

6. Both CSS and JavaScript are written in seperate files.

7. This is the documentation written for the task.
